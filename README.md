### About WhitzardAgent

WhitzardAgent is a research group supported by SII and Fudan, working on the security and safety of LLM-powered agentic systems powered by foundation models.


### Ongoing Projects
#### Agentic Infra
- [**Mirror GUI**](https://github.com/WhitzardAgent/Mirror-GUI) — **LLM-based GUI Simulator for Agentic Data Synthesis and Evaluation**
Mirror GUI is a GUI simulator driven by large language models (LLMs), designed to test and evaluate AI agents interacting with a desktop-like environment. It simulates an Ubuntu-style desktop with application windows, UI elements and a file system so agents can perform GUI actions and researchers can analyze behavior and safety.

#### Agentic Security Toolkits
- [**XuanwuBox**](https://github.com/WhitzardAgent/XuanwuBox) - **Your AI security advisor in the Docker runtime for your agentic system** (To be released)
